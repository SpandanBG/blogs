# Hello world!

Hello world indeed. We coders, whenever we learn a new language, the first program we write is the “Hello world!” program. It gives a slight insight to the workings of a new virtual life. Me, as a coder and lover of fantasy, am all about exploring and creating the unimaginable. This is my escape from the harsh real world. My escape to the unrealism.

```c
#include<stdio.h>;

int main(){

    printf("Hello World\n");

    return 0;

}
```
